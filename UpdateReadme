What's next?

If you'd like to make a profile README, use the quickstart instructions below or follow the instructions in the Managing your profile README article.

Make a new public repository with a name that matches your GitHub username.
Create a file named README.md in its root. The "root" means not inside any folder in your repository.
Edit the contents of the README.md file.
If you created a new branch for your file, open and merge a pull request on your branch.
Lastly, we'd love to hear what you thought of this exercise in our discussion board.
